* Instructions
 1. esy
 2. esy b dune exec ./c/test.exe

* Stubgen
  Needs an ml file that will create stubs. This file will use Ctypes to do so

* Hacks
  - MyLibBindings had to be cloned - MyLibBindingsClone. Same module must not be used in multiple stanzas?
  - ctypes_cstubs_internals.h had to be written to builddir since it is in "" and gcc couldn't find it despite providing it with correct path
